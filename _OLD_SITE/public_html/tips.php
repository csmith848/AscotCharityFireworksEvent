              the risk of spending time in a traffic queue and have more fun.<br>
              You might consider coming by train; The venue is approximately 5 mins walk from
              the station and the path is now lit by permanent street lighting.</span></p>

          as possible to allow plenty of time to park and make your way in to the event. Why not take time to explore the
          fantastic Ascot Racecourse site. For those that haven't been since the change of buildings, its worth a good look
          around. <br>This year the fireworks entrance opens before the end of racing, so why not experience a bit of what Ascot is famous for!
          <br><br>Please allow at least half an hour to park your car, walk to the gates and find a comfortable viewing location.</span></p>

          young children. Coats, gloves, scarves etc are recommended, especially for the walk between home
          or car parks and the Grandstand.<br>
          Depending on the weather, on the day and preceding days, there may be mud in the car park areas, so wear
          boots. <br>The majority of the grandstand area however is free of such muddy problems.</span></p>

		  Please check local signage on the night for details.<br>Please remember where you parked your car. Whilst the marshalls do their best to keep vehicles and

		  racesourse. Therefore the heath will be closed most of day on Saturday for safety. The gates that normally allow access from various locations
		  onto the heath will all be locked from around mid-saturday morning until after the event is finished and the site has been made safe.</span></p>

          <span class="tips"><br>We have not held a bonfire for many years. Originally this was due to lack of space in our old venue as the crowd
		  size increased. When we moved to the racecourse site, whilst there is loads of space, there isn't any suitable location to have a
		  bonfire which would be safe, allow good access and not cause damage to the venue. Therefore, sorry there is no bonfire and we therefore
		  do not accept offers for supplies for such.</span></p>

          <span class="tips"><br>The display lasts approximately 20 minutes. We do our best to ensure the display starts on-time or very close to the advertised time
		  however occassionaly we do need to delay the start. If we do need to do this, we will make an annoucement to advise the expected delay and will do everything possible

		  sell-out, it is extremely unlikely - although we can hope!</span></p>

		  with all amounts raised going to our charity fund. This money is collected by our volunteers at the head of the queue and not the ride operators,
		  who concentrate on your safety.</span></p>

        <h5>Safety</h5>
        <p>We are grateful for the help of Thames Valley Police and Ascot Fire Brigade.</p>
        <p>If you suffer any injury, please seek out the trained volunteer staff at the First Aid Station. They are
        always very pleased to help.</p>
        <p>Please help us by being responsible. Drive carefully. Please do not cross any barriers
        erected for your safety.</p>
        <p><i>For your own safety, we <b>do not allow</b> you to bring alcohol or your own fireworks to
        the event. <b>This includes sparklers: they are too dangerous where there are crowds
        and excited children. </b></i></p>
        <p>Please follow directions. We reserve some spaces for disabled people, please ask
        any Official Marshall (who will be wearing high visibility jackets). Please do not
        park in front of any gates, which may be entry and exit points for emergency vehicles.
